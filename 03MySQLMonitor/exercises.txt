1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?

Clients, kind of like users, can 'log in' to server and use the database operations such as storing or reading data.  The "monitor" program is the client I'll be using which allows me to create the database and control almost all aspects of it and maintainance.

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (Weâ€™ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)

/******Name: 'SELECT'
Description:
Syntax:
SELECT
    [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
      [HIGH_PRIORITY]
      [STRAIGHT_JOIN]
      [SQL_SMALL_RESULT] [SQL_BIG_RESULT] [SQL_BUFFER_RESULT]
      [SQL_CACHE | SQL_NO_CACHE] [SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS]
    select_expr [, select_expr ...]
    [FROM table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ... [WITH ROLLUP]]
    [HAVING where_condition]
    [ORDER BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ...]
    [LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
    [PROCEDURE procedure_name(argument_list)]
    [INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'
        [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
        export_options
      | INTO DUMPFILE 'file_name'
      | INTO var_name [, var_name]]
    [FOR UPDATE | LOCK IN SHARE MODE]]

SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and
can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [HELP UNION], and
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/subqueries.html.

The most commonly used clauses of SELECT statements are these:

o Each select_expr indicates a column that you want to retrieve. There
  must be at least one select_expr.

o table_references indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve
  rows. Its syntax is described in [HELP JOIN].

o The WHERE clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions
  that rows must satisfy to be selected. where_condition is an
  expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The
  statement selects all rows if there is no WHERE clause.

  In the WHERE expression, you can use any of the functions and
  operators that MySQL supports, except for aggregate (summary)
  functions. See
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/expressions.html, and
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/functions.html.

SELECT can also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?

Interactive mode lets you view commands and batch mode pulls from a file (esp if u want to restore a database from a file).  Also, batch mode lets you run a series of operations frequently (like a stdio.h library but a cached file, maybe)?

4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?

User let's you connect to MYSQL server, you canals use a default username , which is your machine account name.  The password is not needed if there's isn't one, but if there is one it needs a password or the connection will fail. The database options let you pick which database to use (for example, in the beginning there's the information mysql database, the performance test database, and the example music database if you found a way to download it from the old MYsql site.).
