Homework for Chapter 2 of Learning MySQL (2006 edition), from p. 94:

Exercises:
1) What is command completion?
CTRL D or CTRL F, saves typing by cycling through file matches

2) What are the relative advantages of installing MySQL using the package,
 directory archive (tarball or "no-install", or compiled methods?

By using the compile, you make sure that you have the most recent version of the software and get a performance increase of up to 30%.  However, it can be error-prone and tedious.

3) How do you verify the integrity of downloaded packages?

You can run an algorithm such as MD5  that checks the data of the file and comes up with a 128-bit number, or checksum, from the data file.  It's almost impossible to keep the original file checksum the same as a modified file without altering the checksum of the original file.
Macintosh:Documents Rena$ md5 mysql-5.5.29-osx10.6-x86.dmg
MD5 (mysql-5.5.29-osx10.6-x86.dmg)	 = 	e76cca091725a054f2f0abdc8a143604
Macintosh:Documents Rena$ 

file's checksum 			=	e76cca091725a054f2f0abdc8a143604

match					=  					100 %

4) How do you add the MySQL bin directory to the operating system path?
 you have installed the Startup Item, use this command:

     shell> sudo /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM start
     (ENTER YOUR PASSWORD, IF NECESSARY)
     (PRESS CONTROL-D OR ENTER "EXIT" TO EXIT THE SHELL)

If you don't use the Startup Item, enter the following command sequence:

     shell> cd /usr/local/mysql
     shell> sudo ./bin/mysqld_safe
     (ENTER YOUR PASSWORD, IF NECESSARY)
     (PRESS CONTROL-Z)
     shell> bg
     (PRESS CONTROL-D OR ENTER "EXIT" TO EXIT THE SHELL)



Additional Exercises (not in the book): 
1) Document how you installed MySQL and any issues you came across with installation. 
 (The goal is to be easy to install it again on a similar machine.)
It was extra steps to have to sign up with Oracle and register my usage, but not difficult.

2) Document where important files should be.
